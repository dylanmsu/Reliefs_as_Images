# Reliefs_as_Images
Based on the original paper: [Reliefs as Images](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ab0a33c25a1bef4a9eeecc7e80634799d522d494)

My plan is to build a working implementation in python and switch to c++ to acheive a realistic performance. In python it takes days to weeks of computation for a single relief.
